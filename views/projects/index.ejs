                    <p>
                        This project seeks to interpret the human interactions exhibited through social media into music 
                        by procedurally generating a musical composition using a Facebook post as input. The
                        composition is based off of the Facebook Reactions (i.e. Like, Love, Wow, etc.) associated with
                        the input post. Each reaction has an associated melodic phrase which floats over an oscillating
                        drone. A disproportionate amount of Like reactions led to the inclusion of an additional phrase
                        representing a sequence of uninterrupted Likes.

                        The inspiration for this project came from observing Facebook interactions following the tragic 
                        massacre at the Pulse Orlando nightclub on June 12th, 2016. Many of my peers posted heartfelt and
                        sensitive messages on Facebook in response to the tragedy, and many of these posts had emotionally-charged discussions
                        in the comments section. One particular discussion was over the insensitivity of reacting to a 
                        memorial/grieving post with a Wow reaction. Observing this phenomenon and the ensuing debate led me to
                        observe a particular significance to these digital reactions. My initial reaction was to apply the 
                        concept of a reaction-generated composition to the Pulse Orlando Facebook page. However, transforming a specific
                        post proved much more effective and feasible, which led to the current iteration that allows users of
                        the project generate compositions from posts on their own timeline.
