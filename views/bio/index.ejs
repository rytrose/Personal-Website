                    Ryan is currently attending Georgia Institute of Technology in pursuit of a Masters degree in Music Technology.
                    He is a Graduate Research Assisstant under Jason Freeman, and the software lead on <a class="bioA" target="_blank" href="https://adamlab.gatech.edu/tunetable/">TuneTable</a>,

                    Ryan's research interests center around groups of people and collaboration in music. How can a mass of people influence a performance as a set of individuals? 
                    How can technological performances communicate system behavior to an audience? In what ways can audience interaction be accessible yet musically stimulating?
