                    For this group Ryan has written over a dozen arrangements of contemporary songs. He has also arranged for
                    female a cappella, mixed a cappella, and various non-choral chamber groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a computer engineering student and programmer, Ryan has worked with numerous languages on an array of
                    projects that can be found on his <a class="bioA" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rytrose">github account</a> or on this site

                </p>
                <p>
                    Ryan is currently attending Georgia Institute of Technology in pursuit of a Masters degree in Music Technology.
                    He is a Graduate Research Assistant under Jason Freeman, and the software lead on <a class="bioA" target="_blank" href="https://adamlab.gatech.edu/tunetable/">TuneTable</a>,
                    a tangible user interface for teaching middle- and high-school kids computational concepts while making music.

                <p>
                    Ryan's research interests center around groups of people and collaboration in music. How can a mass of people influence a performance as a set of individuals?
                    How can technological performances communicate system behavior to an audience? In what ways can audience interaction be accessible yet musically stimulating?
