# myWebsite

A website containing my portfolio of works as a musician and a developer. Built using sails.js and Bootstrap.

## Ideas for Music
* Each page (route) is a different instrument/track
  * Home page is a drum beat
  * Bio is a melody, etc.
* Composition persists through visits via cookie
* Clicks / in-page interactions fire one-shot musical events
* Ability to mute tracks
* Need some sort of variability across visits
  * Seed a process with time?
  * Ability to change styles?
    * Should be minimally configurable, want this to be a mostly passive experience
